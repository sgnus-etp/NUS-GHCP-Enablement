https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc52b1dd-6204-496a-8642-08395d5b9da6

## Import Repository using Command Line

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Clone the repository using the command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://URL_OF_YOUR_SOURCE_REPOSITORY.git
     ```

2. **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub org sgnus-etp](https://github.com/sgnus-etp/) and [create a new repository on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). You'll import your external Git repository to this new repository.

3. **Create a Token and Authorise**:
   - Create a [Classic Token PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) with repo scope under your user account.
   - [SAML authorize](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) it against your organization sgnus-etp.

4. **Add Remote and Push**:
   - Navigate to your cloned repository in the terminal.
   - Add the GitHub repository as a remote replacing USERNAME with your GitHub handle and TOKEN with the PAT you've created:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://USERNAME:TOKEN@github.com/sgnus-etp/YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
     ```
   - Push your code to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin master
     ```
**Failure Cases**:
   - If you have error executing the command, try running the below command and retry step 4.
     ```bash
     git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
     ```
## Best Practices for Researchers

- **Be specific in your comments**: Provide clear context about the research task you're trying to accomplish
- **Iterate on suggestions**: Treat Copilot suggestions as a starting point and refine as needed
- **Use pseudocode**: Outline your algorithms in comments or Chat before implementation
- **Request explanations**: Ask Copilot to explain complex code by adding a comment with your question
- **Learn from suggestions**: Study Copilot's code to improve your own programming skills
